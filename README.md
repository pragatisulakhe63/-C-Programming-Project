# -C-Programming-Project
This Project is used to emulate all the functionalities provided by File system

1. Name of Project : 
     Customised Virtual File System Project.

2. Technology Used :
     System Programming using C

3. User Interface Used :
      Command User Interface.

4. Platform required :
      Windows NT platform OR Linux Distributions.

5.  Architectural requirement :
      Intel 32 bit Processor

6.   About Virtual File System :
       In this project we emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to manage file system oriented tasks.
	As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in primary storage.
	In this project we create all data structures which required for file subsystems as Inode Inode Table, File Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor 		Table, Super block, Disk Inode List Block, Data Block etc.
	We provide all implementations of neccessary system calls and commans of file subsystem as open,close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, 	 Fstat etc.
	While providing the implementations of all above functionality we use our own data structures by referring Algorithms of UNNIX opeating system.
	By using this project we cant get overivew of UFS(UNIX File System) on any platform.
